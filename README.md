# Online-Examination-Website
Website that allows students and teachers to login and depending on their credentials, can take CS coding exams or create new questions as well as grade them.

Since I was responsible for the backend portion of this project, I developed the main logic of the website which was analyzing the answers to questions and checking to see if they were correct or not, and then automatically grading. This was an open ended style exam so I needed to run the code students wrote in their answers and to see if correct output was achieved or not. Algorithm also checks to see if answer was hard-coded in. I also implemented features that allowed teachers to add new questions as well as adjust the grading.
